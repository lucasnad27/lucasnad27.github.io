# Excusitis
Speaks on many different types of excusitis (e.g., health) but the one the really resonated with me was **intelligence**
## Intelligence Excusitis p.32
> Stickability is 95% of ability  
This stems from... 
1. Underestimating your brain power
2. Overestimating other’s brain power
> The thinking that guides your intelligence is much more important than how much intelligence you may have  

Leaders are _human engineers_

> Attitudes > Intelligence  

## Fear
> Action cures fear  
**Prime cause of low self-confidence** ::Mismanaged memory::
### Fear of people p.62
1. Get a balanced view of the other fellow
2. Develop an understanding attitude. Remember to repeat...::Underneath he’s probably a very nice guy Most folks are:: —Hotel Clerk story

> Do what’s right and keep your confidence  

### Think Confident, Act Confident p.69
1. Be a front seater - builds confidence. “Nothing inconspicuous about success”
2. Practice making eye contact
3. Walk 25% faster
4. Practice speaking up
5. Smile big

## How to think BIG p.75
Communicating to others - projecting a “movie” in their head
Here are some examples...
_We face a challenge_ —> _We have a problem_
_We made a big investment_ —> _We incurred a large expense_

### How to think creatively p.101
::Believe that you can create!::

> Progress is your most important product p.111  
1. Believe it can be done. **When you believe, your mind finds ways to do**
2. Don’t let tradition paralyze your mind. _Be receptive to new ideas_ and _new approaches_
3. **How can I do...** successful combo below
	1. better? (Quality)
		1. No limit to self-improvement!
	2. More? (Quantity)
		1. Capacity is a state of mind. 
		2. Helps to find intelligent shortcuts
4. Practice asking & listening - the raw material of sound decision making
	1. ::Big people monopolize the listening, small people monopolize the talking.::
5. Stretch your mind
	1. Stimulate
	2. Associate w/ people who help you think of new ideas
	3. Mix with _people of varying occupational & social interest_

> Belief releases creative powers

::Pay 2x & buy half as much::
